# Wk12-Bamazon
Super cool backend that works in the terminal.  I built the backend to a simple version of amazon from scratch!
You can see the videosof how it works in my repo.

After you fork the repo,
Decide whether you want to see the Customer View (In the CLI type : "node BamazonCustomer.js") or Manager View(In the CLI type : "node BamazonManager.js")!

In Customer View, simply follow the prompts.
